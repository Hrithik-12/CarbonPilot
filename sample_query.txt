SCENARIO OVERVIEW
The recent product carbon footprint analysis reveals a critical need for focused sustainability intervention, particularly given the Steel Frame component accounts for over two-thirds ($68.4\%$) of the total calculated emissions. While this data successfully pinpoints high-impact material types like Steel, the failure to process an item due to the absence of 'Vibranium' in the database underscores a major operational gap. Immediate priority must be placed on both sourcing lower-carbon alternatives for the dominant steel material and ensuring comprehensive emission factor coverage for all materials used, thereby guaranteeing the integrity and completeness of the final environmental inventory.

SUSTAINABILITY GOAL
Analyze the following sustainability targets for a manufacturing operation and outline the three most critical strategic initiatives required to achieve them. The primary goal is to significantly reduce the carbon intensity of goods and eliminate data calculation errors. Targets include: 1) A 15% reduction in the emission factor for Steel (from $1.85$ to $\le 1.57 \text{ kg } \text{CO}_2\text{e}$/kg), which is the largest contributor ($68.4\%$); 2) Achieving a $100\%$ successful calculation rate by integrating all missing material emission factors; and 3) Piloting sustainable sourcing to reduce Cotton T-Shirt emissions by $5\%$ (from $1,060$ to $\le 1,007 \text{ kg } \text{CO}_2\text{e}$). The output should be a prioritized list of three initiatives with brief justifications.
